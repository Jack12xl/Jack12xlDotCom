Hi there! I'm a senior student of Computer Science in Shanghaitech University. If condition(COVID 19) permits, I would purse master Computer Sicence program in University of Pennsylvania. 

My research interests include **Computer Vision**, **Computer Graphics** and **Deep learning**. 

Besides these research topic, I also interest in playing video games and making my own.

Currently, I plan to defer for 0.5 ( most likely, 1 ) year and stay at ShanghaiTech University as a Research Assistant. Supervised by Professor [Xiaopei Liu](http://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/liuxp/), I am focusing on learning based fluid simulation.
